                Hi! <a href="#AboutMe" >I’m Abbey</a>, a computer engineer at Purdue University. 
                I am thrilled to share what I have learned and experienced in technology
                 in relation to ethics. This website is highly interactive and will require 
                 you to click around and engage with the content all over the page. I’ve tried 
                 to include easter eggs and unexpected features to help you learn about technology 
                 ethics conversation with tech itself! Dig in and feel free to 
                 share any feedback or questions with me at this form <a href="">*insert form here*</a>. 
                 I’d love to hear from you as I am also still learning and this tool will hopefully 
                 grow with me as I learn.

                <h1 class="font-weight-light">Ethics Education</h1>
                <p>
                  Currently there is a large gap in technology education when it comes to the 
                  conversation of ethical design. For the last 30 years it has been known that technology 
                  ethics are best taught by integrating them into current classes curriculum. While there 
                  is research to support this idea, there is still a distinct lack of curricular 
                  inclusion of these topics. As a computer engineering student I have yet to receive a 
                  coding assignment that includes ethical considerations as a part of my coding assignment. 
                  The only time I have learned about ethics was in a 0 credit hour seminar introducing us to 
                  our major where we had 1 lesson that discussed ethics as an engineer. Here is the course description 
                  where one learning outcome is 
                  <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/Academics/Undergraduates/UGO/CourseInfo/courseInfo?courseid=32&show=true&type=undergrad">“an appreciation for ethical, professional and academic conduct.” </a>
                  It is not surprising that there still exists a mindset of software engineers that ethical 
                  considerations are simply not part of their job. I hope that this tool is an easy way to start thinking 
                  about ethics and what should be considered when designing technology beyond what a powerpoint lecture could do.

              <p>
                To begin my learning about design ethics I read about design justice. They are given below and I think 
                are a great way to open up our thinking about tech design, beyond current practices in industry. These 
                principals, created by the Design Justice Network, challenge many common practices and systems of oppression 
                that industry reinforces. If you click on those principals I explained a quick example of current industry 
                practices or linked to an external resource that relates to that principal in detail.

                  This too often is what my teams look like both professionally and accademically. 
                  There is a dire need for increased diversity and inclusion in the tech sector. Often industry blames it on a "pipeline problem"
                  claiming that people of color and women are discouraged from joining the industry. While there is merit to this clame with it can be 
                  problamatic because it puts the <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/discriminatingsystems.pdf">"onus to solve issues of discrimination in Silicon Valley on
                    those who are discriminated against, rather than the perpetrators"</a>. 
                  
                The following are some recomendations from the same <a href="https://ainowinstitute.org/discriminatingsystems.pdf">article</a> for companies to address the diversity issue outside of looking to the "pipline problem"
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Publish compensation levels, including bonuses and equity, across all roles and job categories,
broken down by race and gender
                  </li>
                  <li>Ensure executive incentive structures are tied to increases in hiring and retention of underrepresented groups.</li>
                  <li>End pay and opportunity inequality, and set pay and benefit equity goals that include contract
                    workers, temps, and vendors. </li>

                    <p>
                      While transparency can be a means of exposing the wrongdoings of companies, it can at times come at
                      the cost of vulnerable groups who depend on privacy to protect “counter hegemonic ideas and strategies”.
                      The comparison has been made between the modern transcripts and those those of the organizers of the underground
                      railroad during US slavery. Revealing these through “radical transparency” would have similarly dramatic impacts
                      on these vulnerable populations.

                    <h5>Transparency can reveal too much information to be easily understood</h5>
                    <p>
                      Transparency seems ideal if one assumes that they will only be given the information on importance, but this is not 
                      always the case. Companies can use what is called resistant transparency to reveal a surplus of information to conceal 
                      the actually important information.

                      Like with the garbage data dump that you saw at the beginning of this section seeing what is being collected was likely 
                      not that much insight into what this website had the potential to do with your data. In order for one to have a deep 
                      understanding of a system and its effects it is necessary to physically interact with it and see how changes made on the 
                      system change its outputs. Understanding how a system interacts with our data and its components is how a system can truly 
                      be monitored and regulated. If we can only see the system and our data that deep understanding of the system will be missing.

                      data was if you first had a base understanding of how digital data collection is constructed. Beyond this transparency
                      is also only meaningful if you have a platform to discuss what you are seeing with other individuals. Systems that have
                      both of these conditions are impossible to find.

                  <p class="text-white m-0">Hi! I’m a current junior at Purdue University studying computer engineering. I am originally from a small town in Upstate New York. I am the director for outreach for Purdue’s branch of Society of Women Engineering. In this club I host events to encourage girls in 2nd - 12th grade to get excited about STEM related fields. I have a strong interest in ethical design, specifically with technology as a woman in engineering. I have had some experience in industry through a software engineering internship. I also have had exposure to the research side of tech and presented my research at the NSF conference for a secure and trustworthy cyberspace. Through all of these experiences and independent study of technology ethics I know that the technology field has quite a lot of work to do to become a space that empowers the communities that need us most instead of exploiting them. I feel in my formal course of study I haven’t been encouraged to learn about the social and ethical impacts of design, despite how critical education is to transforming the industry. I hope that this website gives some insight into what I have learned and help anyone interested in this field to learn more about the ethics of technology in an interactive and engaging way.

                    The problem space in which a piece of technology is designed can lead to incredibly biased systems regardless of how “unbiased” artificial intelligence can seem to be. 
                    In Indiana an automated welfare system was implemented and<b> within 2 years there was a 12.2% increase in incorrect denial of food stamps</b> for those who were applying for assistance.
                    It is not surprising to find that the automation program was designed to reduce “fraudulent” welfare claims by replacing human case workers with AI systems. 
                    The intention of this system was to reduce welfare claims, and that came at the cost of those who needed governmental assistance most. With this new system clients no longer had a personal
                    connection with their caseworkers and struggled to connect to people who could help them get back on welfare because of how depersonalized the system became. Simply because it was a computer
                      booting people off of their welfare, does not make the system fair or equitable.

                    The claim has been made historically that data and the AI tools trained on that data are unbiased because they are designed to require minimum human input and make decisions based on algorithmic training. 
                    The issue is that areas that have been historically over policed due to structural injustices in policing methods will be overrepresented in the data sets being used to train these models.
                    This will cause these policing prediction models to disproportionately predict crime in these same over policed areas, reinforcing the structures of inequality that it was “fixing”.

                  AI systems cannot be the deemed ethical third parties because their results are only as unbiased as the people interpreting those results. Historically with risk assessment models,
                  the results have been misinterpreted or misused to justify unjust sentencing for criminal offences. An example of this is when judges use scores  that are intended to inform probation
                    and instead using them to determine sentencing.  Additionally it is worth mentioning that this is a very obvious example of how limited problem formulation can lead to a perpetuation of the existing problem.

              Tech is inherently designed with the dominant structures of power encode. Facebook’s real name policy excluded 
              people without “traditionally European” names because their algorithms for recognizing 
              <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3189696">"were trained on real name datasets that over-represent European names”</a>.
