        <h1 class="font-weight-light">Justice Principals</h1>
        <p>Below are 10 principals according to the Design Justice Network with some direct connections to topics discussed later.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none;" class="mt-2">
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 1</h4>
                <p>We use design to sustain, heal, and empower our communities, as well as to seek liberation from exploitative and oppressive systems.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 2</h4>
                <p>We center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcomes of the design process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 3</h4>
                <p>We prioritize design’s impact on the community over the intentions of the designer.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 4</h4>
                <p>We view change as emergent from an accountable, accessible, and collaborative process, rather than as a point at the end of a process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 5</h4>
                <p>We see the role of the designer as a facilitator rather than an expert.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 6</h4>
                <p>We believe that everyone is an expert based on their own lived experience, and that we all have unique and brilliant contributions to bring to a design process.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 7</h4>
                <p>We share design knowledge and tools with our communities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 8</h4>
                <p>We work towards sustainable, community-led and -controlled outcomes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 9</h4>
                <p>We work towards non-exploitative solutions that reconnect us to the earth and to each other.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Principal 10</h4>
                <p>Before seeking new design solutions, we look for what is already working at the community level. We honor and uplift traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge and practices</p>
            </li>

                The problem space in which a piece of technology is designed can lead to incredibly biased systems regardless of how “unbiased” artificial intelligence can seem to be. 
                In Indiana an automated welfare system was implemented and<b> within 2 years there was a 12.2% increase in incorrect denial of food stamps</b> for those who were applying for assistance.
                 It is not surprising to find that the automation program was designed to reduce “fraudulent” welfare claims by replacing human case workers with AI systems. 
                The intention of this system was to reduce welfare claims, and that came at the cost of those who needed governmental assistance most. With this new system clients no longer had a personal
                 connection with their caseworkers and struggled to connect to people who could help them get back on welfare because of how depersonalized the system became. Simply because it was a computer
                  booting people off of their welfare, does not make the system fair or equitable.

                The claim has been made historically that data and the AI tools trained on that data are unbiased because they are designed to require minimum human input and make decisions based on algorithmic training. 
                The issue is that areas that have been historically over policed due to structural injustices in policing methods will be overrepresented in the data sets being used to train these models.
                 This will cause these policing prediction models to disproportionately predict crime in these same over policed areas, reinforcing the structures of inequality that it was “fixing”.

                AI systems cannot be the deemed ethical third parties because their results are only as unbiased as the people interpreting those results. Historically with risk assessment models,
                 the results have been misinterpreted or misused to justify unjust sentencing for criminal offences. An example of this is when judges use scores  that are intended to inform probation
                  and instead using them to determine sentencing.  Additionally it is worth mentioning that this is a very obvious example of how limited problem formulation can lead to a perpetuation of the existing problem. 
                With this solution of using technology to replace the judge in determining bail instead of considering eliminating the cash bail system all together.

        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p class="text-white m-0">Hi! I’m a current junior at Purdue University studying computer engineering. I am originally from a small town in Upstate New York. I am the director for outreach for Purdue’s branch of Society of Women Engineering. In this club I host events to encourage girls in 2nd - 12th grade to get excited about STEM related fields. I have a strong interest in ethical design, specifically with technology as a woman in engineering. I have had some experience in industry through a software engineering internship. I also have had exposure to the research side of tech and presented my research at the NSF conference for a secure and trustworthy cyberspace. Through all of these experiences and independent study of technology ethics I know that the technology field has quite a lot of work to do to become a space that empowers the communities that need us most instead of exploiting them. I feel in my formal course of study I haven’t been encouraged to learn about the social and ethical impacts of design, despite how critical education is to transforming the industry. I hope that this website gives some insight into what I have learned and help anyone interested in this field to learn more about the ethics of technology in an interactive and engaging way.
